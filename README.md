## Assembly Instructions

1. **Print Files:** Print the two **STL** files included in this repo. 
   > **Note:** The file `Optional_locking_base` is a legacy version with closed ends. You don't need to print it if you plan to tape the lid shut. While the normal lid closes, it can occasionally pop open; the legacy file is designed to prevent the PCB from sliding out.

2. **PCB Installation:**
   * Insert the **antenna** first.
   * Carefully bend the plastic near the **power button** and slot it in while **aligning** the holes with the **PCB**.

3. **Final Step:** Lastly, put the **cover** on.
